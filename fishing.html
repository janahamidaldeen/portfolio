      Bye Bye Trash Hello Fish is an interactive desktop game developed using Python and Tkinter, where the objective is to catch floating trash while avoiding fish.  Players control a vertically descending hook to collect as much trash as possible within a countdown timer. The game features one type of fish and two types of trash that move horizontally across random positions in an underwater scene.    </p>
    <p>
      Designed for all ages, the game includes a points system that rewards players for catching trash and penalizes them for catching fish. The project emphasizes clean and intuitive user interaction, real-time movement animations, and gameplay logic that balances challenge and fun.    </p>
    <p>
      Through this project, I strengthened my skills in event-driven programming, animation handling, and user interface design in Tkinter. I also gained experience in design and optimizing performance for smooth, responsive gameplay.
