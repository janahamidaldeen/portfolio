    <p>
      FishGame is an engaging mobile app that allows users to participate in an interactive game where they catch fish of various sizes and colors. The game is designed to enhance hand-eye coordination and provide a fun challenge. The user controls a fishing net that moves across the screen to catch the fish that appear. The app is designed for all ages, offering both casual play and timed challenges.

      This project was developed using Swift, integrating a user-friendly interface and smooth animations to create an enjoyable gaming experience. The challenge was in implementing the dynamic fish movement algorithms and achieving optimal performance across various device types.

      Working on FishGame helped me enhance my skills in game development, animation techniques, and performance optimization. The project also contributed to my understanding of user engagement and retention strategies.
